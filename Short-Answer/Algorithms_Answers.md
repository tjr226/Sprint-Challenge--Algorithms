#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)

b) O(n log n). Outside loop is n, inside is log n

c) Looks like the function bunnyEars(bunnies) never terminates if bunnies > 0. Runtime complexity O(n) if bunnies < 0.

## Exercise II

Binary search - drop egg from story n/2. Then take +/- n/4 stairs, next will be +/- n/8 stairs, continuing until the difference is just one.

Runtime is O(log n)
